		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">
		
        <p>I am a PhD student in <strong>Computational Statistics</strong> at the University of Cagliari (Italy), with a deep interest in the intersection between <strong>informatics, statistics, and econometrics</strong>. My current research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and computational statistics, with a particular attention to applications in the <strong>healthcare domain</strong>.</p>
        <p>Before returning to academia, I worked for over seven years in the private sector. At Prometeia (Bologna, Italy), I served as an <strong>econometrician and data scientist</strong>, contributing to projects involving <strong>natural language processing, machine learning, and text/audio analysis for central banks and monetary policy</strong>. I authored working papers on the application of data science to economics, coordinated junior staff, and also delivered training on Excel and VBA.</p>
		<p> Earlier, I worked as an econometrician at Ne Nomisma Energia, developing statistical models for energy prices and analyzing macroeconomic trends in the energy sector. As a financial technology analyst at Accenture, I supported the implementation of derivative products and business analytics for major banking clients. </p>
        <p>I earned a Master’s degree in <strong>Data Science</strong> during the second year of my PhD, and I also hold a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Economics</strong>. I have authored peer-reviewed publications in macroeconomics and sentiment analysis applications. I developed my first MSc thesis in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during a research stay at <strong>IAE Business School</strong>. My academic and professional path includes several international experiences: an Erasmus exchange at WU Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business), a finance traineeship in Bucharest at Confindustria Romania through the Erasmus Placement program, and additional periods abroad in Scotland and Ireland.</p>
		<p>I am fluent in English and Spanish, and certified by Bloomberg and Reuters. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel/VBA, and overall in both Windows and Linux environments.</p>
        <p>I am also the author of <em>Tutto ciò che ci accomuna</em>, a book published as part of a charity project supporting mental health awareness. The initiative includes <em>Voices and Words for Mental Health</em>, a musical tribute to international artists who have experienced mental health challenges.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing, and playing music — I am also a guitarist. I’m passionate about exploring different cultures, and I love sports such as running, snowboarding, and trekking.</p>
