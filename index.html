        <h1>Maria Paola Priola</h1>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Cagliari, with a deep interest in the intersection between informatics, statistics, and econometrics. My current research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and computational statistics, with a particular attention to applications in the healthcare domain.</p>
        <p>Previously, I worked as an econometrician and data scientist at <strong>Prometeia</strong> (Bologna, Italy), where I specialized in <strong>natural language processing</strong>, machine learning, and financial forecasting for central banks and monetary policy institutions.</p>
        <p>I earned a degree in Data Science during the second year of my PhD, and I hold advanced degrees in both Economics and Data Science. I have authored peer-reviewed publications in macroeconomics and sentiment analysis applications.</p>
        <p>I am also the author of <em>Tutto ci√≤ che ci accomuna</em>, a book published as part of a charity project supporting mental health awareness. The initiative includes <em>Voices and Words for Mental Health</em>, a musical tribute to international artists who have experienced mental health challenges.</p>
