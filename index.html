        <h1>Maria Paola Priola</h1>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Cagliari, with a deep interest in the intersection between informatics, statistics, and econometrics. My current research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and computational statistics, with a particular attention to applications in the healthcare domain.</p>
        <p>Before returning to academia, I worked for over seven years in the private sector. At Prometeia (Bologna, Italy), I served as an econometrician and data scientist, contributing to projects involving natural language processing, machine learning, and text/audio analysis for central banks and monetary policy. I authored working papers on the application of data science to economics, coordinated junior staff, and also delivered training on Excel and VBA.</p>
		<p> Earlier, I worked as an economist at Ne Nomisma Energia, developing statistical models for energy prices and analyzing macroeconomic trends in the energy sector. As a fintech analyst at Accenture, I supported the implementation of derivative products and business analytics for major banking clients. </p>
        <p>I earned a Master’s degree in Data Science during the second year of my PhD, and I also hold a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics. I have authored peer-reviewed publications in macroeconomics and sentiment analysis applications.I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics. I developed my MSc thesis in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during a research stay at IAE Business School. My academic and professional path includes several international experiences: an Erasmus exchange at WU Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business), a finance traineeship in Bucharest at Confindustria Romania through the Erasmus Placement program, and additional periods abroad in Scotland and Ireland.</p>
		<p>I am fluent in English and Spanish, and certified by Bloomberg and Reuters. My technical skills include Python, R, SQL, and advanced Excel/VBA, and I’m proficient across both Windows and Linux environments.</p>
        <p>I am also the author of <em>Tutto ciò che ci accomuna</em>, a book published as part of a charity project supporting mental health awareness. The initiative includes <em>Voices and Words for Mental Health</em>, a musical tribute to international artists who have experienced mental health challenges.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing, and playing music — I am also a guitarist. I’m passionate about exploring different cultures, and I love sports such as running, snowboarding, and trekking.</p>
